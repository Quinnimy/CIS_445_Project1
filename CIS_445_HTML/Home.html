			<p>Quinn Lamkin shook the world when he came to this world in 1996! 
			A modern renaissance man, he has many interests from writing code to 
			blacksmithing, anything to scratch his creative itch. He is always 
			looking for something new to learn, or for inspiration to create 
			something new. If you ever need help he's your guy, as he is always 
			willing to help out. </p>

			<h4>QuinNews</h4>
			<p>Recently I have been playing two video games competetively Super 
			Smash Bros. Ultimate and World of Warcraft. To get a competetive 
			edge I have been writing my own macros in game with LUA, here are a 
			few screenshots of some macros I'm still testing.</p>
			
			<img alt="Demonic Circle Macro" src="images/screen1.png" height="300%" style="height: 100%" class="auto-style1"/>
				<p>The above macro is for the warlock class in WoW, it allows me 
				to move my character around with ease by binding the spells 
				"Demonic Circle" and "Demonic Gateway" to the same key but 
				altering the function if I hold CTRL, SHIFT, or ALT.</p>
				
				<img alt="Ba'al Macro" src="images/screen2.png" height="300%" style="height: 100%">
				
				<p>This macro above is for any player who is looking to find the 
				secret battle pet
				<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=141941/baal">Ba'al</a>! It 
				helps track your progress in case your also a busy person who 
				can't complete the secret tasks required of you to get this 
				adorable little goat!<p>I hope these macros can help inspire you 
				to write your own and make life easier in the World of Warcraft, 
				and feel free to use these freely for yourself!</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>In Other News I recently departed from my job at Wal-Mart as a a sales 
				associate to focus on schooling! I may actually have some free 
				time soon! Working in retail was physically and mentally 
				exhausting, and I'm glad to not be working there anymore!</p>
